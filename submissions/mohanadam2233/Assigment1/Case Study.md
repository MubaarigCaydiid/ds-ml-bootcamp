Clinical Events via Recurrent Neural Networks. Scientific Reports, 6, 26094. Download PDF
Objective: Predict patient hospital readmissions and clinical events using electronic health records (EHRs)
and machine learning to improve patient care and reduce costs.
Methodology: - Data Used: EHR data of over 260,000 patients. - ML Model: Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs) for sequential patient data. - Inputs: Diagnoses, medications, procedures. - Output: Predicted
future diagnoses and likelihood of readmission.
Key Findings: 1. Accuracy over 79% in predicting readmissions. 2. Enabled early identification of high-risk
patients. 3. Improved resource allocation and care prioritization. 4. Model worked across multiple
departments and conditions.
Conclusion: Deep learning models like RNNs can enhance clinical decision-making, reduce readmissions,
and optimize hospital resources.
2. Business: Predicting Customer Churn

Objective: Identify which customers are likely to leave (churn) to improve retention and revenue.
Methodology: - Data Used: Telecom and business customer datasets. - ML Models: Decision trees, logistic
regression, rule-based algorithms, and other ML techniques. - Output: Probability of churn and key factors
driving it.
Key Findings: 1. Over 85% accuracy in predicting churn. 2. Key drivers: late payments, low usage, frequent
complaints. 3. Enabled targeted interventions like promotions and personalized offers. 4. Rule-based
models provided interpretable insights for managers.
Conclusion: Machine learning improves customer retention, maximizes revenue, and provides actionable
insights for business strategy.

Objective: Predict traffic flow in urban areas to reduce congestion and improve traffic management.
Methodology: - Data Used: Traffic sensor data (vehicle counts, speeds, timestamps). - ML Models: Deep
learning (stacked autoencoders, RNNs). - Output: Short- and medium-term traffic flow predictions.
Key Findings: 1. High accuracy compared to traditional statistical models. 2. Adapted to dynamic traffic
patterns caused by accidents or weather. 3. Enabled optimization of signal timings and rerouting strategies.
4. Scalable to large traffic networks.
Conclusion: ML provides predictive insights that improve traffic management, reduce congestion, and
support smart city planning.
