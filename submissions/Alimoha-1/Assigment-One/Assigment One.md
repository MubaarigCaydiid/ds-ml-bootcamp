## 1. Define Machine Learning using a Real-Life Example

**Definition:**  
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on algorithms that can “learn” the patterns of training data and subsequently make accurate inferences about new data.

**Real-life Example:**  
- **Speech Recognition:** like Siri, Alexa and So!

## 2. Compare Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning

### Supervised Learning
- **Definition:** A machine learning approach that uses labeled datasets. These datasets train or “supervise” algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Facial Recognition for Security  
  - Credit Score Prediction

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition:** Uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets, discovering hidden patterns without human intervention.  
- **Example:**  
  - Smart Data Labeling with ML

## 3. What Causes Overfitting? How Can It Be Prevented?

**Overfitting:**  
An undesirable behavior where a model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.

**Prevention Strategies:**  
- Use more training data and eliminate statistical bias  
- Apply regularization and optimize hyperparameters  
- Use cross-validation techniques

## 4. Explain How Training Data and Test Data Are Split, and Why This Process Is Necessary

**Training and Test Split:**  
Separating the dataset into a **training set** and a **test set** allows evaluation of whether the model has truly learned general patterns instead of just memorizing the training data, providing a more reliable measure of real-world performance.

**Why This Process Is Necessary:**  
- To check whether a machine learning model can generalize to unseen data  
- To prevent overfitting  
- To provide an unbiased estimate of real-world performance

## 5. Case Study: Machine Learning in Healthcare

**Study:**  
A 2016 study published in *JAMA* applied deep learning to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images.

**Findings:**  
- The model achieved **high sensitivity (~97%)** and **specificity (~93%)**  
- Demonstrated that machine learning can accurately screen for eye disease at a level comparable to human specialists
