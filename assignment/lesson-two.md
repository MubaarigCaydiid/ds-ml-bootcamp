# Practical Assignment: Data Foundations for Machine Learning

## Task

1. **Collect Your Own Dataset**

   - At least **50 samples (rows)**.

   - At least **5 features (columns)**.

   - You must **create or collect this dataset yourself** — do **not** use pre-made datasets from Kaggle, UCI, or other repositories.

   - Possible collection methods:

     - **Surveys & Questionnaires** (e.g., ask people about age, income, daily habits).
     - **Measurements** (e.g., record weather, temperature, or traffic counts in your area).
     - **Observations** (e.g., note down prices in local shops, sports scores, student grades).
     - **Web scraping / manual logging** (e.g., collect product prices from a site, count hashtags on social media).

   - The dataset can be **messy** (missing values, categorical text, mixed formats). We will clean and preprocess it in **Lesson 3**.

2. **Prepare a Short Research Paper (2–3 pages)** about your dataset:

   - **Title & Collection Method:** What is your dataset about, and how did you collect it?
   - **Description of Features & Labels:** What are the input variables (features X) and the output variable (label y) ?
   - **Dataset Structure:** How many rows and columns? Include a **small sample table** (5–10 rows).
   - **Quality Issues:** What problems exist (missing values, typos, duplicates, imbalance, etc.)?
   - **Use Case:** How could this dataset be used in a Machine Learning project (regression, classification, clustering)?

This assignment ensures you **experience real-world data collection**, not just theory.
In **Lesson 3**, we will take your datasets and apply **preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling, feature engineering)**.
